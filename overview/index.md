## Why Needed?
As education enters the digital age it has become increasingly possible to remove barriers and open up access to all. As part of that transformation educators have begun to make extensive use of open educational resources and open practices. Instead of authoring or purchasing proprietary resources educators have begun to create, share, and use Creative Commons licensed digital resources that provide permissions for reuse, revision, remix, redistribution and retention. Textbooks, videos, images, animations, simulations and other course materials are increasingly digital and open. With the cost of replication of digital naterials being close to zero this generates tremendous cost savings while at the same time opening up innovations in teaching and learning.  

Creative Commons has become a key means by which educators find, create, and share open course materials in the form of Open Educational Resources (OER). Use of OER has generated new open practices for everything from designing and developing a course to teaching and learning. 

The CC Educator Certificate aims to ensure all educators have the grounding and digital literacy associated with successfully using Creative Commons for open educational resources, open practices, open policy, and open pedagogy. Learning activities generate practical tools and resources to be applied and used in work right away.
