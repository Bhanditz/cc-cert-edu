## Why Needed?
Educators have always been knowledge sharers, helping students develop their abilities and engage in the world around them. With the advent of computing and the Internet, education became increasingly digital. Many educators now incorporate the use of digital and web based materials in their courses. Some even teach online. 

Creative Commons has become a key means by which educators find, create, and share course materials in the form of Open Educational Resources (OER). Use of OER has generated new open practices for everything from designing and developing a course to teaching and learning. 

The CC Educator Certificate aims to ensure all educators have the grounding and digital literacy associated with successfully using Creative Commons for open educational resources, open practices, open policy, and open pedagogy.
