# OER, Open Textbooks, Open Courses, and MOOCs


## Big Question / Why It Matters
Education is more important than ever before. Nothing else can do as much to promote happiness, prosperity, and security for individuals, families, and societies. And while many interesting and useful experiments are occurring outside formal education, the degrees, certificates, and other credentials awarded by formal institutions are still critically important to many people’s quality of life.

Unfortunately, formal education in the age of the internet is, in some ways, more expensive and less flexible than ever. Publishers of educational materials famously charge outrageous prices for textbooks and other resources. As part of their transition from print to digital, these same companies have largely moved away from a model supporting student ownership of educational resources to a "streaming" model where learners have only transient access to resources. Further, publishers are constantly developing innovative technologies that restrict what students and faculty can do with the resources they access, including inventing novel ways to prohibit printing, prevent cutting and pasting, and restrict the sharing of materials between friends.

## Learning Outcomes
* Define "open" in the context of open educational resources
* Differentiate between open educational resources, open textbooks, open courses, and MOOCs
* Identify the problems with MOOCs relative to open education

## Personal Reflection / Why it Matters To You
Does it seem reasonable that education in the age of the internet should be more expensive and less flexible than it was in previous print generations? What impacts have the rising costs and decreased flexibility of educational materials had on you and those you know? What role do you imagine copyright and related laws like the DMCA have played in driving up costs and driving down flexibility for learners and teachers? What role might their be for open licenses to provide relief?

### OER and Open Textbooks

The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation defines "[open educational resources](http://www.hewlett.org/strategy/open-educational-resources/)" (or OER) as follows:

>> Open Educational Resources are teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and repurposing by others. OER include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.

In contrast to traditional educational materials, which are constantly becoming more and more expensive and less and less flexible, open educational resources provide everyone, everywhere with free permission to download, edit, and share them with others. David Wiley provides another popular definition, stating that only educational materials licensed in a manner that provide the public with the [5R permissions](http://opencontent.org/definition/) can be considered open educational resources. The 5Rs include:

    1. Retain - permission to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage)
    2. Reuse - permission to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
    3. Revise - permission to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
    4. Remix - permission to combine the original or revised content with other material to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
    5. Redistribute - permission to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of to a friend)

The easiest way to confirm that an educational resource is an *open* educational resource that provides you with the 5R permissions is to determine that the resource has been licensed under a Creative Commons license that permits the creation of derivative works - CC BY, CC BY SA, CC BY NC, or CC BY NC SA.

Because OER can be as small as a single video, it can be quite difficult or very time consuming for teachers to assemble dozens or hundreds of individual OER into a collection large enough to replace an expensive, traditionally copyrighted textbook. For this reason, open educational resources are often collected and presented in ways that resemble a traditional textbook in order to make them easier for instructors to understand and adopt. The term "open textbook" simply means a collection of OER that have been organized to look like a traditional textbook in order to ease the adoption process. To see examples of open textbooks in a number of disciplines, visit [OpenStax](http://openstaxcollege.org/) or the [Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/).

In addition to demonstrating that students [save money](http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/1700/2833) when their teachers adopt OER, research shows that students can have [better](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12528-015-9101-x) [outcomes](http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2686/3967) when their teachers choose OER instead place of traditionally copyrighted educational materials.

The idea of open educational resources is strongly advocated by a broad range of individuals, organizations, and governments, as evidenced by documents like the [Cape Town Open Education Declaration](http://www.capetowndeclaration.org/read-the-declaration) (2007) and the [Paris OER Declaration](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/what-is-the-paris-oer-declaration/) (2012).   

### Open Courses and MOOCs

In 2007, [David Wiley](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911162731/http://www.opencontent.org/wiki/index.php?title=Intro_Open_Ed_Syllabus) and [Alec Couros](http://eci831.wikispaces.com/Session+List) began experimenting with "open courses." The idea of an open course was to make the syllabus, readings, videos, and other resources used to teach a class formally offered at a university available to the public *and* invite the public to participate in the course by reading, watching videos, participating in discussions on social media, and completing assignments in collaboration with the course's official students. The informal participants did not receive credit from the universities, but they also did not have to apply for admission or pay tuition. Running an open course required instructors to use open educational resources so that they could be accessed and used by all course participants, both formal and public.

In 2008, George Siemens and Stephen Downes jointly offered an open course on Connectivism and Connected Knowledge (CCK08). This course attracted many more public participants that either of the 2007 courses - over 2000 informal students participated. This large number led Dave Cormier to refer to CCK08 as a "massive open online course" or [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course), a reference to the [massively multiplayer online role-playing games](Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) that had become popular in the late 1990s.

Years later in 2011, Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig of Stanford taught an online course in artificial intelligence that did not use open educational resources but encouraged participation from the public. The media quickly described this course as a MOOC, forgetting that the first "o" in MOOC stood for "open." Today, several for-profit and non-profit MOOC providers exist, including Udacity, Coursera, and edX. While they all provide free access to their courses to the public, none of these organizations are committed to creating or using open educational resources like the authors of the original MOOCs were. The pedagogy of these later MOOCs also differs significantly from the diverse, connected practices of the early MOOCs Cormier described in the video above. Recent MOOCs have generally become much more uniform and sterile, and generally consist of watching short videos and answering questions. As described by [Tony Bates](http://www.tonybates.ca/2014/10/13/comparing-xmoocs-and-cmoocs-philosophy-and-practice/), MOOCs based on the earlier, open and exploratory model are generally referred to as cMOOCs, while the later, more homogenized and corporate MOOCs are referred to as xMOOCs.

## Application of Learning

CC Certificates aim to engage you in direct application of learning for personal and / or professional use. Toward that end the following learning activities aim to help you you use and apply basic knowledge in ways directly relevant to you. Learning activities are structured around 1. Creation of a personal learner toolkit. 2 Active participation in CC’s community, and 3. Applied practice.

### Learner Toolkit
Select at least 2 or 3 resources linked above that are relevant to your personal or work related CC needs from the Acquiring Basic Knowledge content and add them to your personal Creative Commons toolkit. Make notes on how you plan to use the information in the future, including sharing them with colleagues.

### Community - Collaboration, Appreciation, Recognition, Gratitude
Reach out to the author of an open educational resource you have seen that impressed you for some reason. Briefly introduce yourself, and then express gratitude for their work creating and sharing an open educational resource.  

### Applied Practice
Complete the following activity in the Quest Bank:
