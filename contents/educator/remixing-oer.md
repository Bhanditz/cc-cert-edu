# Remixing / Adapting Resources

Is everything we create a unique idea or maybe everything a remix as the [great online documentaries by Kirby Ferguson argue](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/)? In school, where learning means repeating, redoing and improving things over time, this question is even more complex.

## The Big Question

Classes, courses, lessons or trainings, no matter on how new and innovative topics always need some reference materials, will use or be based on some pre-existing knowledge and resources. It would be extremely difficult and time consuming for each teacher to create everything from a scratch. That is why the ideas of remix and adaptation are so important not only for culture but also for education.

Creative reuse of materials created by other educators and authors is much more then just inspiration, we cite, copy, adapt, combine different materials to craft our perfect lesson or resources. To do that we have to tackle some issues about copyright, licensing and pedagogy of Open Educational Resources (OERs).

## Learning Outcomes

* Demonstrate how different open resources can be used together
* Ensure license compatibility of licenses in selected materials
* Combine selected resources into a new one
* Adapt existing resources to your and your student needs


## Personal Reflection / Why It Matters to You  
  
What were your last search terms in search engine (or in the library) you used when preparing your resources or lessons? How do you filter and and recognize the materials you would like to use? Can you think about some future lesson or thing you will author (like a learning material, textbook or lesson scenario) and note what kind of resources (for example definitions, illustrations, games, quizes etc.) will you need to use to create that?

Think (and write down if you want) answers to those questions. 



## Acquiring Essential Knowledge 

From the open course [Learning to (Re)Use Open Educational Resources](http://www.exploerercourse.org/), language teacher Elizabeth McDonnell from the Open University describes how she prepares for teaching with OERs

*["How do you go about preparing your class? ExplOERer Course"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfRSEvlCGUM) by [Bea de los Arcos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGk2P9Eg7bfBkA9xyO6Z-sA) is licensed under [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)*


It’s also useful to define most common activities that we will be discussing in context of OER’s:

* **Revising:** Altering the textual content or media in an OER 
* **Adding:** Including new (previously unlicensed) textual content or media in an OER
* **Remixing:** Combining two or more existing OERs

Those were proposed by [OER Hawaii project](https://oer.hawaii.edu/), where you can [read more about creative workflow](https://oer.hawaii.edu/tag/remixing/) and how OER creation fits into projects like preparing a textbook.  

Naturally there are concerns about the quality of OER because they are typically made available for free. Users may worry about the source of a resource; for example, whether the resource was created by a legitimate institution or knowledgable individual. Institutions may worry that releasing materials exposes flaws in teaching practices or materials. Many argue that the transparency of process will result in better quality resources than those developed in a closed environment.

The [Jisc Infokit on Open Educational Resources](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/open-educational-resources/quality-considerations) suggests the following criteria for assessment of quality:

* Accuracy
* Reputation of author/institution
* Standard of technical production
* Accessibility
* Fitness for purpose

There is also a role for subject specialists (educators and librarians) in assessing the quality and suitability of a particular resource.

If a resource can be improved, it should be improved: and then re-released on an open licence so others can benefit from better quality OER.

But including others materials and combining materials from different sources can be tricky, not only from pedagogical perspective (on which you are probably an expert in your field) but also from a copyright standpoint. Not everything on the internet is OER, and even from things called open many are not free to remix. How to recognize them and then how to choose those that will be compatible? 

For concerns about copyright status of works you want to remix, read those two modules from the [Maricopa Community Colleges OER Faculty Workshop](Open Content to Transform the Classroom) to understand differences between open access and open educational resources, citations and collections.

If you are already feeling copyright savvy or want to use only open resources, all the information on which licence types can be remixed with each other from in educational context you will find in the [Remixing OER unit](http://www.open.edu/openlearnworks/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=82520&section=2 ) from the Open University course on [Becoming an Open Educator](Becoming an open educator)

For more knowledge specifically about combining content under different licenses review the unit on [Remixing Differently Licensed Works](../licenses/remixed.md).

If you are looking for more inspiration how to bring remixing and adapting resources to your classroom as an instructor or want to inspire your students to do that on their own see the [Remixing Open Content](http://bcopened.org/resources/mashing-oer/) resource shared  by the [BC Open Educational Technology Collaborative](http://bcopened.org/).


To help you understand better how to remix and adapt educational materials safely try testing yourself with [the quiz about tricky copyright scenarios in OER context](https://maricopa.instructure.com/courses/805732/quizzes/821784?module_item_id=5179463) from the [Maricopa Community Colleges OER Faculty Workshop](https://maricopa.instructure.com/courses/805732/).

## Application of Learning

CC Certificates aim to engage you in direct application of learning for personal and / or professional use. Toward that end the following learning activities aim to help you you use and apply basic knowledge in ways directly relevant to you. Learning activities are structured around 1. Creation of a personal learner toolkit. 2 Active participation in CC’s community, and 3. Applied practice.


### Learner Toolkit

Select at least 2 or 3 resource repositories or search methods relevant to your personal or work related CC needs from the Acquiring Basic Knowledge content and add them to your personal Creative Commons toolkit. Make notes on how you use the search method/repository (where to find ratings, content that you have have found using this search method, etc).


### Community - Collaboration, Appreciation, Recognition, Gratitude

From the Creative Commons news blog, Facebook page, Twitter stream and web pages identify at least two other educators or organizations who are using Creative Commons in a similar way you or your organization do or want to do. Note these people or organizations in your toolkit along with questions you might have for them in concerning advice or lessons learned from searching for and evaluating OER for classroom use. 

### Applied Practice

Complete the following activity in the Quest Bank:
